# The Task
You are required to build a **SPA** (Single page application) using any frontend framework (React JS preferred) which is a chat application.
Pages in the application :

## Chat Page
1. A chat page is a chat window where users can chat with the mirror chatbot (i.e. essentially a chatbot that sends back the user input).
2. An input field where the user can enter his message and a send button alongside to send the message.
3. A chat window where chat between user and chatbot is shown.
4. A header on top of the page with a chatbot image and name.

### When a user sends a message in the chat view, the same message will be echoed back which will be shown as the response message from the mirror chatbot in the chat window.

## Note:
1. Create a beautiful responsive design that should work seamlessly on the web, tablet & mobile.
2. You can use any CSS framework.
3. Use any browser storage to store the chat history of the user so that when the user comes back to his chat it is resumed from the same place.
4. Save your code to a git repository and share the URL with us.

## Bonus:
1. Deploy the code on any hosting service and share the URL ( Netlify, Github pages, etc.)
2. Write unit test cases for your application.
